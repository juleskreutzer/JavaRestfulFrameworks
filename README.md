# Java Restfull Frameworks
*This repo is used to demonstrate different java RESTful frameworks.*

#### Usage
 * To make it easier to test the different frameworks, we use [SnoopEE](https://github.com/ivargrimstad/snoop)
 * There is a client available (client.html) where you can test the different frameworks
 
#### Setup
It still is our goal to run these frameworks using SnoopEE. Because a virtual machine running the service is not yet available, you need to run the service on your own (if you want).

**1. Get Docker**

To run SnoopEE, Docker is required. Go and install Docker from [https://www.docker.com](https://www.docker.com)

**2. Get SnoopEE**

You can use Kitematic to search and create SnoopEE. It will automatically setup SnoopEE.
